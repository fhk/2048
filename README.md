# WordVec Search
Based on [2048](http://git.io/2048),
based on a small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](www.machineslearning.xyz)

## What on earth have you made?

- use the pretrained googlenews [wordvector](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?usp=sharing)
- use gensim to load it up (urgh its huge...)
- find a nice set of words to use. [The Noun List](http://www.desiquintans.com/nounlist)
- extract their vectors
- reduce their dimensionality
